<b>Dataset</b>: Record of deaths caused by pneumonia and influenza in US across 10 years from 2009 to 2018.<br/  >

<b>Analysis 1</b>: Get a general idea about the data by plotting a time line on a national level.
Conclusion: We observe that there is a rise of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza during the begining of the year. This trend gradually decreases as the climate becomes less extreme.

Analysis 2: Get a distribution of deaths by age group.
Conclusion: We observe that people in the age group 65 and above are most vulnerable to pneumonia and influenza as compared to others. Also children in the age group 17 and below seen to be least affective. This could affectively prove that vaccination drives and similar measures taken to cater people n the age group 17 and less were effective to a great extent and similar measure of more have to be undertaken for people in the age group 65 and above.

Analysis 3: Get the distribution of deaths by region over 10 years.
Conclusion: We observe from the trend that Region 4 containg states Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee have a higheest number of deaths compared to others. Since this is a 10 year trend we can conclude that these deaths are not due to seasonal weather changes or other seasonal factors.

Analysis 4: Get the total deaths and percentage of deaths across Region 4.
Conclusion: Since we have analyzed that Region 4 is most vulnerable, we drill further to perform state-wise analysis. Also, since Florida has the highest population amongst the states in the region, getting a sum of the count of deaths could be misleading. Hence we analyse with percentage of deaths across the state.

Analysis 5: Get the number of beds in all hospitals in all states in Region 4.
Conclusion: The total number of hospital beds in Florida is greater than other states in the same Region by a big margin.
